Q2.   Explain Web Front End(WFE) cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?
Ans:  The Power BI service architecture is based on two clusters â€“ the Web Front End (WFE) cluster and the Back-End cluster. The WFE cluster manages the initial connection and authentication to the Power BI service, and once authenticated, the Back-End handles all subsequent user interactions.


Q3.   Explain Back End cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?
Ans:  The Back-End cluster is how authenticated clients interact with the Power BI service. ... The Gateway Role acts as a gateway between user requests and the Power BI service. Users do not interact directly with any roles other than the Gateway Role. Azure API Management will eventually handle the Gateway Role.


Q4.   What ASP.NET component does in Power BI Service Architecture?
Ans:  The ASP.NET component within the WFE cluster parses the token to determine which organization the user belongs to, and then consults the Power BI Global Service. The WFE specifies to the browser which back-end cluster houses the organization's tenant.
